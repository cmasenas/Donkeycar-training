# Donkeycar-training
A Jupyter Notebook for training donkeycar data.

This notebook may be easier for beginners to follow.  I found Will Roscoes excellent code to be daunting so I endeavored to simplify it for my own understanding.

This notebook may also be easier to experiment with new training models.  It includes graphic display of training loss and display of measured vs predicted outputs.

I use this notebook with Anaconda in the donkey environment but it isn't necessary.
